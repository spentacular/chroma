# Chroma

A color picker that focuses on color selection

## About

Chroma is a color picker built using [React Color](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color). I wanted to create a color picker that focuses on color selection while active, but gives a full view when not.

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out Webpack bundling
- [ ] Add ability to save colors
- [ ] Add ability to copy in other color formats (rgb/hsl)
- [ ] Add dark/light contrast option
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Make scroll shifting more performant
- [ ] `cmd/ctrl + c` copies color
- [ ] `cmd/ctrl + p` pastes color (that would be so cool)
- [ ] Better random colors
- [ ] Option to randomly select a color
